Architecture
=========================

Scheduler
--------------
campaign queueing
--every 5 mins check for campaigns that need to fire & queue
--triggers gcp function
--function gets campaigns that need to fire (based on nextFireDate < now(), in the past)
--send to pub/sub which triggers queueing function
--queueing function gathers messages and queues or fails messages

message sending
--every 5 mins check for messages that need to go out
--triggers gcp function
--function gets messages that need to be sent (those in company queue collections) 
--send to pub/sub which triggers sending function
--scaled sending function (because of pub/sub) gathers messages and sends

Incoming messages & dispositions
---------------------------------------
open a route that a function responds to (or pub/sub directly attached to): /messages/incoming
--route this as needed based on headers: companyId, messageId
--update message items, status, dates, etc
--of course this'll have some kind of authentication or confirmation it's from Twilio, or other external provider

Data ingest - the action of taking a file and loading it into the DB
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Upload from portal (or API later) per campaign
--Find the data sources that haven't been loaded
--find the file name
--try to load that file into its appropriate data table
--track results and progress

Message mapping -- the action of pulling fields from data and applying a message format to it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--we don't care about the data that is uploaded, as long as the message template and data fields line up
  --this allows for custom data fields across the board for companies
--campaign definitions define contact window, message mapping, confirm/cancel/reschedule options, contact methods (can have multiple types per campaign)
--we allow a campaign preview before it is marked as ready and can fire
--at campaign fire time, or now if on-demand, we gather messages, apply their template, and send

Message Queuing
---------------
Special char detection
Phone number format check
Email format check
Message deduplication
  What is a dupe?: Same day, same person, same doctor, same end contact point (email, phone)
Message Assembly: apply fields to template
  --trim whitespace per field - this is manadatory and does not fail any message
A message fails to queue if any steps fail here.
  Campaign row gets flagged and moved into failures collection with detailed information of its failure

Reporting
------------------------------
Reports can be ran against campaigns, customers, and dates

Dashboard Features
---------------------
upload data
review data
manage api keys
manage campaigns: create, edit, preview, view status
