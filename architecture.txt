Sending Architecture
-----------------------

Build:
    --Create SQS and lambda poller per packet
    --Use a lambda to create this set

Teardown:
    --Remove when campaign is removed
    --Use a lambda to remove this set

Lambda: get packets and their data
    --send to appropriate SQS depending on the packet

SQS:
    --each packet (campaign) gets its own SQS queue
    --limitation for now is 120k per queue (campaign)

Lambda:
    --poll its SQS queue
