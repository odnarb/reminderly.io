- minus sign is just listing an item
x- means that item is done
-------------------------------------------

x- create db
x- create mock schema
x- create mock get messages table / data / proc
x- create node.js app to get messages from mysql db depending on run type
    x - update table to say batch is complete (stored proc)
x- flesh out db schema
x- flesh out logging tables
- plan better solution for storing logs
    http://brian.moonspot.net/logging-with-mysql

x- need logging tables
x- need log offloader script
    x- log tables can be dumped out after x days to a .sql file, and then rotate the table
    x- simply use the mysqldump command for relevant tables

x- TODO: figure role company restriction (or allow list) via role table

x- proc moves data to history
    x--removes entries from log tables

x- table of contact methods
x- table of contact status / description

- figure out a shard method
    - and how it works into the db design

last consideration:
    -I split messages and messages_contact_status tables.. now we need to maintain history for both tables and rotate both?

- flesh out ui supported features/actions
- plan api gateway / api endpoints for supporting the platform
- write with swagger

- review stored procs already created, may need corrections based on changes to the db design
- stored procs for maintenance fleshed out
- stored procs fleshed out: temp tables, where clauses
- write stored procs


- plan indices
- write indices
- create tests for failures ..?
- create tests

consider:
track user interactions with the system -- users most likely to respond and respond postively to surveys and reviews
