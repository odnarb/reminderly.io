Data process:
    Data Ingest
        via campaign settings:

        Post-Ingest: Field Mapping
            if [field20] == "sms" --> send as sms and use [field6] for phone number
            else send an email and use [field23] for email address

        Post-Ingest: Cleaning / Field Manipulation
            Phone number validation (just validates format)
            Email format validation (this doesn't capture all issues)
            Filter/chop off certain text (such as "Bill amt:")

    Message Assembly
        Create message templates of messages from mappings
            a mapping determines what fields are available to the user for creating templates

    Rules
        Filter duplicates
            What is a duplicate?
            Same day, same message, same end contact point
