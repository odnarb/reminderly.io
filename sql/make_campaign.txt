/*
-a campaign should have at least one data source.. (MVP just one)
-a campaign each data source has a mapping
-a campaign should have contact methods
-a campaign should have messages defined
-a campaign should have a schedule of contact windows.. or now..
-a campaign should define if confirm, cancel, reschedule options available

For certain contact types we will need a bare minimum of fields defined and mapped:
    sms: to, message body
    email: to, subject line, message body
    phone: to, message body

    * if the message template pulls from a field that's not available in the map, then we'll throw an error


    ('SFTP','This source means the data packet came from the SFTP source'),
    ('API','This source means the data packet came from the API'),
    ('UI','This source means the data packet came from our web portal upload');
