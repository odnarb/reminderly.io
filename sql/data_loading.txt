Development flow
-----------------
test sql with direct sql statements
load test file loads
load test outbound (outbound is a mock -- setTimeout)



data loading
-----------------

ingested - file is recorded to be "in the system", but data not loaded yet
loaded - rows have been loaded into the system, no transformations made
mapped - rows have been tagged with appropriate metadata, or transformed
    -- message functions applied and built out
queued / contacting - rows have been copied into appropriate contact queue tables
    -- last chance to cancel contacts
complete -- all contacts have been completed (whether errors were encountered we need to look into individual contact statuses)
